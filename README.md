## Project: Capstone Proposal and Capstone Project

This project is based on a Kaggle competition posted by Santander bank. The goal of this competition is to help Santander predict whether a given customer is a satisfied or unsatisfied customer. Customer satisfaction is an important measure for businesses. Unhappy customers are easy to lose and rarely voice their dissatisfaction before leaving.

By helping to identify dissatisfied customers early in their relationship, we give Santander the opportunity to take proactive steps and improve a customer's happiness before it's too late. Reducing churn is something really important for most companies, considering that acquiring new clients is much more expensive than working on the current relationships and keeping them active and profitable.

More information about this competition can be found on https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-customer-satisfaction as well as the data needed to solve it.

The solution has been written in python 3 and is based upon the following libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Sklearn, Counter.
